  Besides Stan, there are several probabilistic language programming libraries
  based on the deep neural network related framework, such as Pyro
  \cite{bingham2019pyro}, which is based on Pytorch.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    It fully supports GPU by Pytorch. So they can easily handle large scale of
    data sets.
  \item
    It supports variational inference (eg. VAE) and NUTS for sampling.
  \item
    It's easier to install and implement than Stan.
  \end{itemize}

  With the help of the scanpy \cite{wolf2018scanpy}, which is a Python package specific designed
  to handle large scale of scRNAseq dataset, we could write our method using Pyro
  when the model is mature.
