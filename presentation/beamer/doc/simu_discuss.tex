  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Simulation: current batch effect is added \mywarn{after count generation}, while in
    our model, we model batch effects on \myemph{gene expression level}.
  \item
    Gene modules: batch effect estimation might be hard. So how about consider
    two gene modules: one is for the false positive ones, and the other is for
    the positive ones. Then let each of them share the same batch effect. And we
    estimate the batch effect on gene-module level.
  \item
    Pseudobulk analysis might over estimate the genes if the genes have lots of zero
    counts.
